imageMe is a super simple image gallery server.

Run imageme.py from the top level of an image directory to generate gallery
index HTML and run a SimpleHTTPServer on the localhost.

Imported as a module, use imageme.serve_dir(your_path) to do the same for any
directory programmatically. When run as entry point, imageme.serve_dir('.') is
what's called.
